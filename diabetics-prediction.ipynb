    "In 2018, about 10.5% of Americans were estimated to have diabetes. Furthermore, about one-fifth of those cases were undiagnosed. Early detection is key in diabetes because early treatment can prevent serious complications. When a problem with blood sugar is found, doctors and patients can take steps to prevent permanent damage to the heart, kidneys, eyes, nerves, blood vessels, and other vital organs.\n",
    "A patient must go through several tests, and checked for multiple factors, in order to be diagnosed with diabetes. The long process makes it difficult for doctors to keep track and can lead to inaccurate results which makes the detection very challenging. Due to recent advances in machine learning algorithms it is now possible to conduct a fast and accurate prediction of the disease in candidate patients."

    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

    "The platform chosen for this exercise is a Jupyter notebook. For data scientists, notebooks are a crucial tool. Notebooks are a form of interactive computing, in which users write and execute code, visualize the results, and share insights. Typically, data scientists use notebooks for experiments and exploration tasks.\n",
    "It is not expected of you to fully understand the code, it is here for you if you’d like to dive deeper, but whether this form of presentation allows me to integrate the computing environment and to facilitate the work of a data scientist to you.\n",

    "#### Python and python packages\n",
    "The python programing language has dominated the field of machine learning for the past years. There are two main reasons; One, python is a relatively simple to pick up for non-coders and facilitate the most intuitive programing syntax. The second reason, and the more important one, is the abundance of packages available for python users, especially for data scientists. A python package is a program written in python and offers some specific functionality to the user. For example, the ‘pandas’ package allows for handling csv and text files easily, ‘scikit-learn’ wraps almost all common machine learning algorithms, making it easy for us to quickly test variety of methods on our data.\n"
