# Predicting Diabetes - A Machine Learning Approach

## Description

This project is part of the 8400 Health Network initiative and was presented in a workshop for the BigData in Healthcare course in July 2023. The project uses machine learning to predict diabetes based on health metrics. The dataset contains various health metrics for a number of individuals, some of whom have been diagnosed with diabetes. The goal is to train a machine learning model on this data, so that it can predict whether a new individual has diabetes based on their health metrics.
