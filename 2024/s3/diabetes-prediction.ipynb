    "## Predicting Diabetes - A Machine Learning Approach\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be exploring the use of Machine Learning (ML) for predicting diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. Hyperglycaemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.\n",

    "We will be using a dataset that contains various health metrics for a number of individuals, some of whom have been diagnosed with diabetes. Our goal is to train an ML model on this data, so that it can predict whether a new individual has diabetes based on their health metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic example of a binary classification problem, where each individual is classified into one of two categories: 'has diabetes' or 'does not have diabetes'. We will be exploring various ML models and techniques to tackle this problem."

    "This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

    "#### Python and python packages\n",
    "The python programing language has dominated the field of machine learning for the past years. There are two main reasons; One, python is a relatively simple to pick up for non-coders and facilitate the most intuitive programing syntax. The second reason, and the more important one, is the abundance of packages available for python users, especially for data scientists. A python package is a program written in python and offers some specific functionality to the user. For example, the ‘pandas’ package allows for handling csv and text files easily, ‘scikit-learn’ wraps almost all common machine learning algorithms, making it easy for us to quickly test variety of methods on our data.\n"
